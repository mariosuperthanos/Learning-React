
Redux: State Management Library

- Store Initialization  
  Redux encourages using a single store for your web application. You can initialize it as follows:  

  configureStore({ reducer });

- Accessing Data  
  To ensure that components always get the latest data from the store:  
  - Subscribe the component to the store using React's `useSelector` hook:  

    useSelector(state => state.specificData);

  - This behaves similarly to managing local state in React.

- Modifying Data  
  - Use reducers to define how the storeâ€™s state changes.  
  - Trigger these reducers in a component with the `useDispatch` hook:  

    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    dispatch(action);

- Redux Toolkit  
  Redux Toolkit simplifies state management by streamlining the creation and management of reducers,
 making it easier and more efficient to work with Redux.
